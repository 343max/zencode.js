This morning I was quite flashed by Zen Code, an really simple way to write HTML Code.
http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/

With this you can write something like

div.article>p*3 and expand it to this:

<div class="article">
	<p></p>
	<p></p>
	<p></p>
</div>

So I asked myself, why there is not something like this in JavaScript, for, say, jQuery.

So I hacked up zencode.js.

For now it's quite simple and I'm quite sure, there will be some rewrite quite soon, but for now you can do something like this:

var div = $.zencode.expand('div#id.class.anotherClass>p');

to get something you would normaly write this way:

var div = $('<div>').attr('id', 'id').addClass('class').addClass('anotherClass').append('<p>');

or

var div = $('<div id="id" class="class anotherClass"><p></p></div>');

that's not very usefull for now, but maybe I will find a way to hook some callbacks into this.
